# About-me

What I learned in college：
In college, I learned "Advanced Mathematics", "Linear Algebra", "Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics", "C language Programming", "Data Structure", "Dissociation mathematics", "Digital Logic", "C language Design". ", "Computer Audit", "Computer Network", "Operating System", "Computer Configuration Principle", "Software Architecture", "JAVA Programming", "Linux System and Programming", "Oracle Database", "Python Big Data Processing", "Weka Data Mining" and other professional courses.


Projects involved：

library Management System（Apr 2018 - Jun 2018 ）：
The system is based on the Visual Studio environment and is designed with C#. The content of the system is mainly to manage books by updating the information in the database. First, create a database file and edit it. After editing, use Visual Studio to design a common module for the system. After the design is complete, create a program that connects the functional modules of the system framework with the corresponding content in the database. When the user performs operations such as "borrowing" in the system, the current time can be recorded, and the borrower information and borrowing data can be entered in the database specially registered for "borrowing". When all the designed functional modules can accurately interact with the database, a library management system is completed.

Online course selection website（Mar 2019 - May 2019）：
I also participated in the development of the online course selection website, which mainly includes functions such as teachers' online course selection and course coordination. I am responsible for writing the front-end code, testing the post-system and writing the introductory documentation. The front end is the interface design and function module distribution of the whole system. After my design is completed, other students in the team will implement certain functions according to the functional modules. Once the system is complete, I'm responsible for testing if the system can be used. After testing is complete, I also organize and edit the entire team design process, including design concepts, assignments, and questions that arise during different testing sessions.

Lip recognition based on LBP-TOP algorithm and libsvm classifier in Matlab environment（Apr 2020 - Jun 2020）
In my graduation project, I studied lip shape recognition based on LBP-TOP algorithm and libsvm classifier in Matlab environment. It first processes the video data into images through matlab, and then uses the LBP-TOP algorithm to extract the feature values in the images. Then we use libsvm to build the model based on the eigenvalues, and finally test the accuracy of the model with the new data.
